# See wave

Basically this is a sound visualization tool to understanding the sound wave behavior through the numerical way

## so what is sound wave

Sound is a mechanical wave that results from the back and forth vibration of the particles of the medium through which the sound wave is moving. ... The motion of the particles is parallel (and anti-parallel) to the direction of the energy transport. This is what characterizes sound waves in air as longitudinal waves.
